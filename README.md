# Module-9--Lab


Hello World,

Alex here, in this assignment I was able to answer some questions for the assignment.
For each of the questions, I was able to use a loop to be able to make the program run 
the way that it is suppose to run. Some of them use the counter code to be able to count
to a certain number that you tell it to. Each of the problems are able to run and be able to 
display the answer.

From Alex
